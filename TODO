TODO: no instance as instance 0? mask3d reads ply as unsigned int so -1 fucks it up, check what mask3d expects of no instance in gt_data first (WHAT DOES SCANNET DO?)

TODO: integrate noisy terrain tiles with perlin noise:
   - build 'library' of cuttable and non cuttable tile, function ready
   - experiment with tile size
  
TODO: postprocessing:
- transform everything to fit in unit cube? have seen this done in some ML papers. could also save both and compare



TODO: woody debris V2
plan: 2 options
1. select at random from woody debris library
2. do similar to plants, add afterwards OR add in somewhere in tree placement stage, will make it likely closer to trees and better placed but complicates terrain generation etc.

TODO: slope:
  - also have some tiles with gradient, can calculate independent of noise and add as height map, probably for v2

TODO: add understory? we have real terrain with some fallen branches etc., this might not be necessary anymore
plan: 
- 1. select at random from library of cut out plants
- 2. select random location, get height from terrain map (location at least 1m away from trunk locations)
- 3. get bbox of plant, check if collision with any trees
- 4. transform pc of plant until no more collision
