TODO: add understory
plan: 
- 1. select at random from library of cut out plants
- 2. select random location, get height from terrain map (location at least 1m away from trunk locations)
- 3. get bbox of plant, check if collision with any trees
- 4. transform pc of plant until no more collision

TODO: woody debris
plan: 2 options
1. select at random from woody debris library
2. do similar to plants, add afterwards OR add in somewhere in tree placement stage, will make it likely closer to trees and better placed but complicates terrain generation etc.

TODO: postprocessing:

TODO !!!! no instance as instance 0? mask3d reads ply as unsigned int so -1 fucks it up, check what mask3d expects of no instance in gt_data first
