TODO: add understory
plan: 
- 1. select at random from library of cut out plants
- 2. select random location, get height from terrain map (location at least 1m away from trunk locations)
- 3. get bbox of plant, check if collision with any trees
- 4. transform pc of plant until no more collision

TODO: woody debris
plan: 2 options
1. select at random from woody debris library
2. do similar to plants, add afterwards OR add in somewhere in tree placement stage, will make it likely closer to trees and better placed but complicates terrain generation etc.

TODO: labeling of ply:
1. refactor to tensor version of o3d : make sure arrays are c contiguous
2. give each tree point cloud unique id
3. create semantic mapping: 0 -> terrain, 1 -> trees, 2 -> lying woody debris, 3 -> standing woody debris, ..
4. merge everything and save
5. also create downsampled version

TODO: postprocessing:
- transform everything to fit in unit cube? have seen this done in some ML papers. could also save both and compare
