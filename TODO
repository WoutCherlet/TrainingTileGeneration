## V2

TODO: woody debris
plan: 2 options
1. select at random from woody debris library
2. do similar to plants, add afterwards OR add in somewhere in tree placement stage, will make it likely closer to trees and better placed but complicates terrain generation etc.

TODO: slope:
  - also have some tiles with gradient, can calculate independent of noise and add as height map, probably for v2

TODO: add understory? we have real terrain with some fallen branches etc., this might not be necessary anymore
plan: 
- 1. select at random from library of cut out plants
- 2. select random location, get height from terrain map (location at least 1m away from trunk locations)
- 3. get bbox of plant, check if collision with any trees
- 4. transform pc of plant until no more collision
